This powerpoint provides an overview of my master's project which directly covered multiple aspects of Workload Identity Management, Cryptography & PKI, Full-Stack Development, Python, AWS, and AWS Security. Below is a breakdown of how my project aligned with the Security Software Engineering. 


✅ Workload Identity Management
Implemented AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies.
Created IAM users, groups, and roles for secure AWS operations.
Configured Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for AWS users.
Utilized AWS Security Groups to restrict access.
Conducted role-based access control (RBAC) to minimize privileges.

✅ Cryptography & PKI
Integrated AWS Key Management Service (KMS) for encryption of RDS databases.
Configured SSL/TLS certificates for securing web traffic.
Implemented HTTPS redirection with AWS Certificate Manager.
Utilized Amazon Inspector for security assessments to detect vulnerabilities.

✅ Full-Stack Development
Developed and deployed a Django-based full-stack web application.
Configured AWS RDS (Relational Database Service) for database management.
Integrated AWS Simple Email Service (SES) for email notifications.
Deployed a Django web app using AWS Elastic Beanstalk, automating infrastructure provisioning.

✅ Python
The entire application was developed using Python (Django framework).
Utilized Python-based security tools like AWS Inspector and Jinja2.
Implemented Python scripts to automate security and application monitoring.

✅ AWS & AWS Security
Worked extensively with AWS services: IAM, RDS, SES, Inspector, CloudWatch, VPC, and Elastic Beanstalk.
Configured AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF) to mitigate web-based threats.
Integrated Amazon Inspector for vulnerability scanning.
Enabled Amazon CloudWatch for continuous security monitoring.
Addressed AWS misconfigurations related to security groups, IAM, and storage.
